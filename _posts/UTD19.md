title: "UTD19"
excerpt: "UTD19 is a large-scale traffic dataset from over 23541 stationary detectors on urban roads in 40 cities worldwide making it the largest multi-city traffic dataset publically available. The Institute for Transport Planning and Systems ETH Zurich collected the data in a research campaign from 2017-2019. The data mainly consists of measurements from loop detectors, which record vehicle flow and occupancy (or speed) in relatively small aggregation interval, typically 3-5min. The location of all detectors and the associated roads have been geo-coded in WGS84 coordinates making map matching as easy as possible. Its use is open to researchers from all over the world."
