**Introduction**

Welcome to the Subcommittee on Large-Scale Multimodal Traffic Modeling and Mobility Services (LTM) website. Our esteemed group is dedicated to advancing the understanding of traffic flow and control theories for large-scale traffic systems. As a subcommittee under the Standing Committee on Traffic Flow Theory and Characteristics (TFTC), we strive to shape the future of mobility by exploring innovative solutions and enhancing collaboration to create efficient and sustainable traffic networks.


**Our Mission**

Our mission is to:
* Foster collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to address the complex challenges of large-scale traffic management.
* Promote open science by sharing data, research findings, and methodologies.
* Develop innovative solutions for improving traffic efficiency, reducing congestion, and enhancing sustainability.
* Advance the field of traffic flow theory through cutting-edge research and analysis.

**Join Our Community**

We invite you to become a part of our vibrant community of researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts. Join us in exploring the latest trends and innovations in traffic modeling and mobility services. 

**Stay tuned for more updates on our upcoming events, publications, and research projects.**
