title: "pNEUMA"
excerpt: "pNEUMA is an open large-scale dataset of naturalistic trajectories of half a million vehicles that have been collected by a one-of-a-kind experiment by a swarm of drones in the congested downtown area of Athens, Greece. A unique observatory of traffic congestion, a scale an-order-of-magnitude higher than what was not available until now, that researchers from different disciplines around the globe can use to develop and test their own models."
