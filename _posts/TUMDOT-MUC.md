excerpt: "The Trajectories from Urban Multimodal Drone Observations of Traffic – Munich (TUMDOT-MUC) dataset contains trajectories from videos recorded with drones in Munich, Germany, in October 2022. A total of 12 drones were used to observe 6 spatially continuous locations for more than 3 hours each on two weekday afternoons. The spatially and temporally linked data from the 700 m long section along Rheinstraße is currently in the final phase of post-processing. The second recording day (October 12) is now available and can be downloaded. The first day will be published soon. "
